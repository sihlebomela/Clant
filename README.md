# Clant
Clant is __going to be__ web app for identifying a plant by taking picture of it. ðŸŒ¼

I'm still working on getting the main functionality, if you wanna contribute check out projects.

# Run locally
1. Download the code
2. from the terminal, navigate to the directory
3. run `npm install`
4. to run you'll need an api key for plant identification, you can get a free trial api key at [plantid](https://web.plant.id/api-access-request/)

# Stuff im using
- PlantID - Plant Identification API
- Express & Axios - Backend
- p5js - capturing images
